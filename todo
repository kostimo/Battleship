Things likely to be implemented:

[6.12.2024]
* new board design
* dynamic array for GameBoard.shipsOnBoard instead of array
* Ship.direction likely to be boolean and be named smth. like isVertical

* shooting logic for player is not implemented yet (Player.shoot())
* ship overlapping check is not done yet (in GameBoard.placeShip())
* GameBoard may need a method to check if all ships on the board are destroyed
  (could be named isDestroyed). It will be used in Game.checkWinner()
